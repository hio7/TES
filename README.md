- Players must submit a pre-determined sequence of weapons before the match begins.
- Each weapon must be used an equal number of times across the match.
- During the first 1/2 or 1/3 of the game, players must follow their submitted sequence.
- For the remaining rounds, players may choose freely, but must follow a predetermined priority or rotation rule to avoid repetition or abuse.
(This portion remains hidden from the opponent and is intended to test adaptability and enhance the entertainment value of the match.
